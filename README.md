# Conceptual Decision Support System Model
### Conceptual model of a decision support system in which you are planning to travel from Karlskrona to Copenhagen
### Concept Designed by – Suman Barua (sumanbarua576@gmail.com)

### Does Time Matter?
Here travelers will decide whether they want to select route which takes short time to reach or not.

*Yes* - Route that requires short time will be chosen.

*No* - Route that requires long time but more comfort will be chosen.

### Try Again:
1) When travelers cannot select desire travel mode
2) If they are confused
3) If they want to change travel mode or re-select another one

### Does Cost Matter?
Here travelers will decide whether they want to select route which involves low cost to reach or not.

*Yes* - Low cost route will be chosen.

*No* - High cost but more comfortable route will be chosen.

### Direct Route?
Here travelers will select whether they want to travel in direct transports or indirect transports.

*Yes* - Direct transport (means no vehicle change in journey)

*No* - Indirect transport (means one or more than one vehicle change in journey)

### Route Decided?
After coming to an endpoint here a traveler will be asked to confirm their selection.

*Yes* - Current selection is confirmed and travel mode / route selected

*No* - Current selection is cancelled and travel mode / route not selected, and you can select another again

### Try Again:
1) When travelers cannot select desire travel mode
2) If they are confused
3) If they want to change travel mode or re-select another one

### Travel to Copenhagen:
Finally traveler confirmed the selection of travel mode or route, and traveler now on the way to destination by traveler’s chosen mode.
