### Does Time Matter?
Here travelers will decide whether they want to select route which takes short time to reach or not.

__*Yes*__ - Route that requires short time will be chosen.

__*No*__ - Route that requires long time but more comfort will be chosen.

### Try Again:
1) When travelers cannot select desire travel mode
2) If they are confused
3) If they want to change travel mode or re-select another one

### Does Cost Matter?
Here travelers will decide whether they want to select route which involves low cost to reach or not.

__*Yes*__ - Low cost route will be chosen.

__*No*__ - High cost but more comfortable route will be chosen.

### Direct Route?
Here travelers will select whether they want to travel in direct transports or indirect transports.

__*Yes*__ - Direct transport (means no vehicle change in journey)

__*No*__ - Indirect transport (means one or more than one vehicle change in journey)

### Route Decided?
After coming to an endpoint here a traveler will be asked to confirm their selection.

__*Yes*__ - Current selection is confirmed and travel mode / route selected

__*No*__ - Current selection is cancelled and travel mode / route not selected, and you can select another again

### Try Again:
